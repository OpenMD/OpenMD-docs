@article{Zhou:2005rt,
	abstract = {Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) require the growth of a thin (~20 {\AA}) dielectric metal oxide layer, such as Al 2 O 3 , on a ferromagnetic metal layer, such as Co, CoFe, or CoNiFe. The atomic assembly mechanisms that combine to form a uniformly thin metal oxide layer on these metal surfaces are not well understood. The application of molecular dynamics simulations to the growth of metal and metal oxide multilayers that involve more than one metal element has not been possible using the conventional interatomic potentials. A recently proposed modified charge transfer ionic--embedded atom method potential appears to correctly enable the charge transfer between oxygen and numerous metal elements to be modelled in a format amenable for molecular dynamics studies. Here we parametrize this charge transfer ionic--embedded atom method potential for the quinternary O--Al--Ni--Co--Fe system so that a direct molecular dynamics simulation of the growth of the tunnelling magnetoresistive multilayers can be realized.},

@article{Calle-Vallejo:2015qq,
	abstract = {The exploration of heterogeneous catalysts using first-principles calculations can be daunting because the large number of atoms and possible surface geometries. Calle-Vallejo et al. describe a simpler metric for assessing optimal reactivity: a weighted average of surface coordination that includes second-nearest neighbors (see the Perspective by Stephens et al.). The calculations identified three approaches for introducing cavity sites into the platinum(111) surface to improve its performance for the oxygen reduction reaction used in fuel cells.Science, this issue p. 185, see also p. 164A good heterogeneous catalyst for a given chemical reaction very often has only one specific type of surface site that is catalytically active. Widespread methodologies such as Sabatier-type activity plots determine optimal adsorption energies to maximize catalytic activity, but these are difficult to use as guidelines to devise new catalysts. We introduce {\textquotedblleft}coordination-activity plots{\textquotedblright} that predict the geometric structure of optimal active sites. The method is illustrated on the oxygen reduction reaction catalyzed by platinum. Sites with the same number of first-nearest neighbors as (111) terraces but with an increased number of second-nearest neighbors are predicted to have superior catalytic activity. We used this rationale to create highly active sites on platinum (111), without alloying and using three different affordable experimental methods.},

	abstract = {The reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
                  (RNEMD) method calculates the shear viscosity of a
                  fluid by imposing a nonphysical exchange of momentum
                  and measuring the resulting shear velocity
                  gradient. In this study we investigate the range of
                  momentum flux values over which RNEMD yields usable
                  (linear) velocity gradients. We find that nonlinear
                  velocity profiles result primarily from gradients in
                  fluid temperature and density. The temperature
                  gradient results from conversion of heat into bulk
                  kinetic energy, which is transformed back into heat
                  elsewhere via viscous heating. An expression is
                  derived to predict the temperature profile resulting
                  from a specified momentum flux for a given fluid and
                  simulation cell. Although primarily bounded above,
                  we also describe milder low-flux limitations. RNEMD
                  results for a Lennard-Jones fluid agree with
                  equilibrium molecular dynamics and conventional
                  nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations at
                  low shear, but RNEMD underpredicts viscosity
                  relative to conventional NEMD at high shear.},

                  presented. It reverses the usual cause and effect

                  being very simple to implement, the scheme offers
                  several advantages such as compatibility with
                  periodic boundary conditions, conservation of total
                  energy and total linear momentum, and the sampling

	abstract = {A nonequilibrium method for calculating the shear
                  viscosity is presented. It reverses the
                  cause-and-effect picture customarily used in
                  nonequilibrium molecular dynamics: the effect, the
                  momentum flux or stress, is imposed, whereas the
                  cause, the velocity gradient or shear rate, is
                  obtained from the simulation. It differs from other
                  Norton-ensemble methods by the way in which the
                  steady-state momentum flux is maintained. This
                  method involves a simple exchange of particle
                  momenta, which is easy to implement. Moreover, it
                  can be made to conserve the total energy as well as
                  the total linear momentum, so no coupling to an
                  external temperature bath is needed. The resulting
                  raw data, the velocity profile, is a robust and
                  rapidly converging property. The method is tested on
                  the Lennard-Jones fluid near its triple point. It
                  yields a viscosity of 3.2-3.3, in Lennard-Jones
                  reduced units, in agreement with literature

	abstract = {We present a method for simulating clusters or, molecules subjected to an external pressure, which is exerted by a pressure-transmitting medium. It is based on the canoninical Langevin thermostat, but extended in such a way that the Brownian forces are allowed to operate only from the region exterior to the cluster. We show that the frictional force of the Langevin thermostat is linked to the pressure of the reservoir in a unique way, and that this property manifests itself when the particle it acts upon is not pointlike but has finite dimensions. By choosing appropriately the strength of the random forces and the friction coefficient, both temperature and pressure can be controlled independently. We illustrate the capabilities of this new method by calculating the compressibility of small gold clusters under pressure.},

Each shape is a well-defined polytope, derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the point set, with a parameter alpha is-an-element-of R controlling the desired level of detail. An algorithm is presented that constructs the entire family of shapes for a given set of size n in time O(n2), worst case.

A computer program (), in which the user inserts the code needed to determine the structure, produces an structural file that is interpreted by another program () which is in charge of the computation of properties. As simple and yet illustrative examples we consider two cases: (1) dimeric structures composed of ellipsoidal subunits; and (2) toroidal structures, presenting simple equations that predict the properties of toroids with varying radial ratios.},

	abstract = {The solution properties, including hydrodynamic quantities and the radius of gyration, of globular proteins are calculated from their detailed, atomic-level structure, using bead-modeling methodologies described in our previous article (Carrasco and Garcia de la Torre, 1999, Biophys. J. 76:3044-3057). We review how this goal has been pursued by other authors in the past. Our procedure starts from a list of atomic coordinates, from which we build a primary hydrodynamic model by replacing nonhydrogen atoms with spherical elements of some fixed radius. The resulting particle, consisting of overlapping spheres, is in turn represented by a shell model treated as described in our previous work. We have applied this procedure to a set of 13 proteins. For each protein, the atomic element radius is adjusted, to fit all of the hydrodynamic properties, taking values close to 3 A, with deviations that fall within the error of experimental data. Some differences are found in the atomic element radius found for each protein, which can be explained in terms of protein hydration. A computational shortcut makes the procedure feasible, even in personal computers. All of the model-building and calculations are carried out with a HYDROPRO public-domain computer program.

	abstract = {We present an efficient method to obtain single-crystal elastic constants. Using the method, the computation effort for the complete set of elastic constants (21 components for a triclinic crystal) of a crystal under a given strain state is similar to that for the bulk modulus, where the latter is normally calculated first together with the equilibrium volume by fitting the volume-dependent energy to an equation of state. The idea in the efficiency improvement is to apply linear-independent coupling strains to a crystal, and to extract the complete set of elastic constants simultaneously. For the new method, a single set of strains are universally applicable to all crystals, and less number of strains are needed for crystals of higher symmetry. Calculated single-crystal elastic constants of cubic diamond, hexagonal osmium, orthorhombic TiSi2 and monoclinic Mg5Si6 are given as examples.},

	abstract = {Elastic properties play a key role in materials science and technology. The elastic tensors at any order are defined by the Taylor expansion of the elastic energy or stress in terms of the applied strain. In this paper, we present ElaStic, a tool that is able to calculate the full second-order elastic stiffness tensor for any crystal structure from ab initio total-energy and/or stress calculations. This tool also provides the elastic compliances tensor and applies the Voigt and Reuss averaging procedure in order to obtain an evaluation of the bulk, shear, and Young moduli as well as the Poisson ratio of poly-crystalline samples. In a first step, the space-group is determined. Then, a set of deformation matrices is selected, and the corresponding structure files are produced. In a next step, total-energy or stress calculations for each deformed structure are performed by a chosen density-functional theory code. The computed energies/stresses are fitted as polynomial functions of the applied strain in order to get derivatives at zero strain. The knowledge of these derivatives allows for the determination of all independent components of the elastic tensor. In this context, the accuracy of the elastic constants critically depends on the polynomial fit. Therefore, we carefully study how the order of the polynomial fit and the deformation range influence the numerical derivatives, and we propose a new approach to obtain the most reliable results. We have applied ElaStic to representative materials for each crystal system, using total energies and stresses calculated with the full-potential all-electron codes exciting and WIEN2k as well as the pseudo-potential code Quantum ESPRESSO.},

	abstract = {{We have studied the interfacial thermal conductance, G, of the flat Au(111)--water interface using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We utilized two metal models, one based on the embedded atom method (EAM) and the other including metallic polarizability via a density readjusting EAM. These were combined with three popular water models, SPC/E, TIP4P, and TIP4P-FQ, to understand the role of polarizability in the thermal transport process. A thermal flux was introduced using velocity shearing and scaling reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, and transport coefficients were measured by calculating the resulting thermal gradients and temperature differences at the interface. Our primary finding is that the computed interfacial thermal conductance between a bare metal interface and water increases when polarizability is taken into account in the metal model. Additional work to understand the origin of the conductance difference points to changes in the local ordering of the water molecules in the first two layers of water above the metal surface. Vibrational densities of states on both sides of the interface exhibit interesting frequency modulation close to the surface but no obvious differences due to metal polarizability.}},

@article{Duraes:2023kk,
	abstract = {{We present a theory for pitch, a matrix property that is linked to the coupling of rotational and translational motion of rigid bodies at low Reynolds numbers. The pitch matrix is a geometric property of objects in contact with a surrounding fluid, and it can be decomposed into three principal axes of pitch and their associated moments of pitch. The moments of pitch predict the translational motion in a direction parallel to each pitch axis when the object is rotated around that axis and can be used to explain translational drift, particularly for rotating helices. We also provide a symmetrized boundary element model for blocks of the resistance tensor, allowing calculation of the pitch matrix for arbitrary rigid bodies. We analyze a range of chiral objects, including chiral molecules and helices. Chiral objects with a Cn symmetry axis with n \\&gt; 2 show additional symmetries in their pitch matrices. We also show that some achiral objects have non-vanishing pitch matrices, and we use this result to explain recent observations of achiral microswimmers. We also discuss the small but non-zero pitch of Lord Kelvin's isotropic helicoid.}},
