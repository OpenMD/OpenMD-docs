	Abstract = {We present a method for simulating clusters or, molecules subjected to an external pressure, which is exerted by a pressure-transmitting medium. It is based on the canoninical Langevin thermostat, but extended in such a way that the Brownian forces are allowed to operate only from the region exterior to the cluster. We show that the frictional force of the Langevin thermostat is linked to the pressure of the reservoir in a unique way, and that this property manifests itself when the particle it acts upon is not pointlike but has finite dimensions. By choosing appropriately the strength of the random forces and the friction coefficient, both temperature and pressure can be controlled independently. We illustrate the capabilities of this new method by calculating the compressibility of small gold clusters under pressure.},

	Abstract = {Frequently, data in scientific computing is in its abstract form a finite point set in space, and it is sometimes useful or required to compute what one might call the ''shape'' of the set. For that purpose, this article introduces the formal notion of the family of alpha-shapes of a finite point set in R3. Each shape is a well-defined polytope, derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the point set, with a parameter alpha is-an-element-of R controlling the desired level of detail. An algorithm is presented that constructs the entire family of shapes for a given set of size n in time O(n2), worst case. A robust implementation of the algorithm is discussed, and several applications in the area of scientific computing are mentioned.},

	Abstract = { The calculation of hydrodynamic and other solution properties of rigid macromolecules, using bead-shell model methodologies, requires the specification of the macromolecular shape in a format that can be interfaced with existing programs for hydrodynamic computations. Here, a procedure is presented for such a structural specification that is applicable to arbitrarily shaped particles. A computer program (), in which the user inserts the code needed to determine the structure, produces an structural file that is interpreted by another program () which is in charge of the computation of properties. As simple and yet illustrative examples we consider two cases: (1) dimeric structures composed of ellipsoidal subunits; and (2) toroidal structures, presenting simple equations that predict the properties of toroids with varying radial ratios.},

@article{JoseGarciadelaTorre02012000,
	Abstract = {The solution properties, including hydrodynamic quantities and the radius of gyration, of globular proteins are calculated from their detailed, atomic-level structure, using bead-modeling methodologies described in our previous article (Carrasco and Garcia de la Torre, 1999, Biophys. J. 76:3044-3057). We review how this goal has been pursued by other authors in the past. Our procedure starts from a list of atomic coordinates, from which we build a primary hydrodynamic model by replacing nonhydrogen atoms with spherical elements of some fixed radius. The resulting particle, consisting of overlapping spheres, is in turn represented by a shell model treated as described in our previous work. We have applied this procedure to a set of 13 proteins. For each protein, the atomic element radius is adjusted, to fit all of the hydrodynamic properties, taking values close to 3 A, with deviations that fall within the error of experimental data. Some differences are found in the atomic element radius found for each protein, which can be explained in terms of protein hydration. A computational shortcut makes the procedure feasible, even in personal computers. All of the model-building and calculations are carried out with a HYDROPRO public-domain computer program.
